🔍 Key Features:
✅ Multi-modal transport support (Bus, Train, Car)

✅ Shortest path calculation using advanced graph algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra, A*)

✅ Cost-efficient route recommendations

✅ Fastest travel time planning

✅ Easy-to-use interface for inputting source, destination, and preferences

✅ Scalable and extendable architecture

🚀 Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python / Java / (your language)

Graph Algorithms

(Optional libraries or frameworks like NetworkX, Pandas, etc.)

(Optional: GUI or Web Interface using Flask, React, etc.)

📌 Use Cases:
Inter-city travel planning

Cost and time comparison for different travel modes

Route optimization for daily commuting or logistics
